NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::Mongodb - Use MongoDB in Mojolicious

VERSION
    version 1.15

SYNOPSIS
    Provides a few helpers to ease the use of MongoDB in your Mojolicious
    application.

        use Mojolicious::Plugin::Mongodb

        sub startup {
            my $self = shift;
            $self->plugin('mongodb', { 
                host => 'localhost',
                port => 27017,
                helper => 'db',
                });
        }

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
        helper          (optional)  The name to give to the easy-access helper if you want 
                                    to change it's name from the default 'db' 

        no_db           (optional)  Don't install the 'db' helper
        no_model        (optional)  Don't install the 'model' helper
        no_coll         (optional)  Don't install the 'coll' helper

    All other options passed to the plugin are used to connect to MongoDB.

HELPERS/ATTRIBUTES
  mongodb_connection
    This plugin helper will return the MongoDB::Connection object, use this
    if you need to access it for some reason.

  db([$dbname])
    This is the name of the default easy-access helper. The default name for
    it is 'db', unless you have changed it using the 'helper' configuration
    option. This helper will return either the database you specify, or the
    last database you specified. You must use this in order to set the
    database you wish to operate on for those helpers that specify you
    should.

        sub someaction {
            my $self = shift;

            # select a database 
            $self->db('my_snazzy_database')->get_collection('foo')->insert({ bar => 'baz' });

            # do an insert on the same database
            $self->db->get_collection('foo')->insert({ bar => 'baz' });
        }

  coll($collname)
    This helper allows easy access to a collection. It requires that you
    have previously selected a database using the 'db' helper. It will
    return undef if you have not specified a database first.

        sub someaction {
            my $self = shift;

            # get the 'foo' collection in the 'bar' database
            $self->db('bar');
            my $collection = $self->coll('foo');

            # get the 'bar' collection in the 'baz' database
            $self->db('baz');
            my $collection = $self->coll('bar');
        }

  model($db_and_collection)
    This helper functions as a combination of the above, or if you just want
    to use a different notation. An example usage would be:

        # get the number of items in collection 'bar' in database 'foo'
        my $count = $self->model('foo.bar')->count();

        # if you use dotted collection names, no problem!
        my $system_js_count = $self->model('foo.system.js')->count();

        # if you pass it a regular string without dots, this helper will act like C<coll>.
        my $bar_collection = $self->model('bar');

    This helper will set the last selected db to whatever was passed as the
    database part of the argument, so try not to mix and match "model" with
    "coll" and "db".

  find_and_modify($collname, \%options)
    This helper executes a 'findAndModify' operation on the given
    collection. You must have selected a database using the 'db' helper. See
    <http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/findAndModify+Command> for
    supported options. It will return the raw result from the MongoDB
    driver.

  map_reduce($collname, \%options)
    This helper executes a 'mapReduce' operation on the given collection.
    You must have selected a database using the 'db' helper. All options
    from <http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/MapReduce> are supported. It
    will return undef on failure. On success, it will return the raw result
    from the MongoDB driver, or if you have passed the 'as_cursor' option,
    it will return a MongoDB::Cursor object for your result collection.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Based on Mojolicious::Plugin::Database because I don't want to leave the
    MongoDB crowd in the cold.

    Thanks to Henk van Oers for pointing out a few errors in the
    documentation, and letting me know I should really fix the MANIFEST
